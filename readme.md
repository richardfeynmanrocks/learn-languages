# learn-languages

A repository for code written in various languages in an effort to learn some. These may range from tiny snippets to relatively involved programs, and the motivations may range from curiosity and interest, to a genuine want to improve my skills at a language.

## Languages

Some of the languages I have or plan to populate this with are:

- Functional languages like Haskell (or maybe Clojure or even Lisp) to experience a significantly different style of CS.
- Assembly code in various architectures to experience some more low-level programming.
- C/C++ to get better at writing *good* code rather than just code.
- And more depending on my interest!
